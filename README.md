# 👕 Outfit Generator

An **Outfit Generator** application that helps users organize their wardrobes and create outfits.  
Users can upload clothing items, randomly generate outfits, save favorites into customizable closets, and reload them later.  

This project was built in **Java** and **JUnit** with a focus on object-oriented design and modularity for my CPSC210 project.
